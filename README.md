- 👋 Hi, my name is Olakitan Osibogun. 
- 👀 I love reading Christian books that are expository on the books of the Bible.
- 🌱 I am currently learning python and Javascript in Bootcamp Summer coding school. I also hope to collaborate with as many seniors and giants in the coding world that come my way.
- 💞️ I do hope to learn as much as possible so that I would be able to apply the skills to many mathematical and numerical procedures that I have learnt over the years in physics and mathematics.
- 📫 My email address is olakitanosibogun@gmail.com and my mobile contact is +229-98123345
- 😄 Even though I am in my late forties, and I observe that coding is generally patronized by the youths; I believe age is just a number and I could still do much better with good determination and commitment.
- ⚡ See you in class…
